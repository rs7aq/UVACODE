The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the models for many similar designs of \"centralized green areas\" at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the Lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson\\'s ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.\\n\\nMost notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by similar buildings built at: [[Duke University]] in 1892; [[Columbia University]] in 1895; [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902; [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1904; [[Rice University]] in 1910; Peabody College of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1915; [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Killian Court (1916)|Killian Court]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1916; the Grand Auditorium of [[Tsinghua University]] built in 1917 in Beijing, China; the Sterling Quad of [[Yale Divinity School]] in 1932; and the university\\'s own [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration|Darden School]] in 1996.\\n\\n[[File:Lawn_UVa_south_toward_Old_Cabell_Hall_2010.jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Winter view toward the South Lawn]]\\n\\nFlanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student housing rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called \"serpentine\" because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard|title=Grizzard, Frank E.\\'\\'Documentary history of the construction of the buildings at the University of Virginia, 1817–1828\\'\\'.

The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the help of overzealous faculty member [[William Holding Echols|William \"Reddy\" Echols]], who attempted to save it by throwing roughly {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of [[dynamite]] into the main fire in the hopes the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson\\'s own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. Perhaps ironically, one of the university\\'s main honors student programs is named for him. University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect [[Stanford White]] to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson\\'s design and redesigning the Rotunda interior—making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a president\\'s house. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda\\'s northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were moved to the South Lawn in White\\'s new buildings.{{Citation needed |reason= sources definitely exist for this, but they are not listed here | date= August 2019 }}\\n\\nThe White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge \"quadrangle\", albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the [[University of Cambridge]] or [[University of Oxford]].\\n\\nIn concert with the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Stanford White\\'s changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson\\'s original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson\\'s birthday, April 13, 1976. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] came to visit the Rotunda in that same year for the Bicentennial and had a well-publicized stroll of the Lawn.

The campus of the university is referred to as the \"Grounds\". Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years to reflect Jefferson\\'s belief that learning is a lifelong process, rather than one to be completed within four years.\\n\\n[[File:William Faulkner 1954 (2) (photo by Carl van Vechten).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[William Faulkner]] once lived among the students of UVA after winning the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], and bequeathed most of his papers to Shannon Library.]]\\n\\n===Student-faculty interaction and connections===\\nProfessors are traditionally addressed as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" at UVA instead of \"Doctor\" (although medical doctors are the one exception) in deference to Jefferson\\'s desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. UVA facilitates close interactions between students and professors in a number of ways.\\n\\nFirst-year students in the College of Arts & Sciences have the opportunity to take two University Seminars, one per semester, which are later made available to other years students as well. These small classes, typically numbering from 4 to 19 students each, provide opportunities to work closely with professors at the university from the outset of a student\\'s academic career. The small groupings also help facilitate more frequent and intense discussions between students in this closer environment.\\n\\nSelect faculty live at [[Brown College at Monroe Hill]], [[Hereford College]], [[International Residential College]], and in Pavilions on [[the Lawn]]. This living arrangement gives more opportunities for professors to invite students to lunches and dinners, which regularly happens, and creates chances for impromptu meetings and interactions between faculty and students around Grounds.\\n\\nReflecting this close student-faculty interaction at UVA, it welcomed Nobel Laureate [[William Faulkner]] to a position as \"Writer-in-Residence\" in 1957.<ref name=Blotner>Joseph Blotner and Frederick L.

(1959) \\'\\'Faulkner in the University: Conferences at the University of Virginia, 1957–1958\\'\\'.</ref> He had no teaching responsibilities, and was paid merely to live among the students and write. He was badly injured in a horse riding accident in 1959, and did not return to the state before his death in 1962.<ref name=Blotner /> Faulkner then bequeathed the majority of his papers to Shannon Library, giving UVA the largest Faulkner archives in the world.<ref>[http://uvamagazine.org/articles/faulkner_revisited Faulkner, Revisited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616201223/http://uvamagazine.org/articles/faulkner_revisited |date=June 16, 2017 }}, accessed June 6, 2017</ref>\\n\\n===Global citizenship initiatives===\\nThe [[International Residential College]] is a [[residential college]] at UVA that attracts and celebrates students from across the globe who choose to attend the university.
