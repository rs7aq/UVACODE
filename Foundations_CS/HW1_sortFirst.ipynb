        "In a two class, classification problem, it is common to use a classifier that outputs confidences (rather than simply class labels). A good example of this is a Support Vector Machine. A pro for using such a classifier is that you gain more information -- specifically the confidence in the classification result. A con is that in order to make a final classification decision, a threshold value must be determined. For example, if a threshold of 0.75 is chosen, the class label 1 would be assigned for confidences greater than 0.75 and for confidences less than 0.75 a class label of 0 would be assigned. However, this begs the question: how is the threshold chosen?\n",
        "\n",
        "Many data scientists will choose a threshold based on the experimental results and/or operational constraints. In this code example, we assume that we have confidences and true labels for a large data set. To determine a good threshold we will compute the true positive rates (TPRs) and false positive rates (FPRs) at all relevant thresholds. The relevant thresholds are considered those that would change the TPRs and FPRs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code below, a function is defined to compute the TPR and FPR at all relevant thresholds. However, the code is not very efficient and can be improved. (Note there are tips and hints found in the comments.)\n",
